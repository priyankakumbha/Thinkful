<h1>Hi, I'm Priyanka</h1>

<p>Introduction

I’m a Front End and iOS developer who loves good design, good coffee, and good people. I work as a Front-End Development and iOS mentor for Thinkful, a web developer for IdeaBase, and a freelance iOS developer.

I love the web and all the awesome things that come out of it. I’m excited to live and work in a time of huge advances in web technology. It’s easier than ever to share and collaborate with others, all because of the Internet.

Education is also super important to me - I come from a family of educators - and I’m stoked to work with Thinkful’s awesome student community.

Where I’m From

I’m from the India - Maharashtra, specifically - Solapur, even more specifically. I love the spacious fields, the smell of the outdoors, and the people in India. I bring a bit of the Midwest work ethic to all my projects - a craftsman’s approach to Doing Things Right the First Time.

I’m finishing my design degree at Kent State University, and will be graduating this winter with a focus in interaction design.

I’d love to open my own mobile game studio in the future!

I’ve been programming since I was in middle school. I decided to go to school for design because I love front-end and felt like I needed more help with the design side than the programming side.
